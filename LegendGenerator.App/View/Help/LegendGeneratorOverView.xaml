                The legend generator is a ArcMap 
                program extension and installable tool into the ArcMap 
                graphical user interface. It is written in C#.NET and ArcObjects 
                and is freely usable as "Free Software" (see license agreement), but not as "Open Source Software". 
                The functionality of the tool was designed particularly to the requirements 
                of traditional „geological cartography“. Only from one legend table, which containes 
                all symbol names, a legend can be created graphically in the page layout of ArcMap. Using the 
                same legend table ArcMap layers become symbolized. Symbol definitions can be 
                saved thereby originally and only once in the legend table. ArcMap mxd's or layer files 
                in all variations and versions are no longer necessary for the graphical representation of 
                a geological map. A complete map can be copied thereby by an editor at the next in one Geodatabase file (mdb file).

                <Bold>1. Create the legend template:</Bold>
                <LineBreak/>
                The legend generator takes graphic elements in the page layout for sketch the construction of the legend. 
                Thus the legend template can be arranged graphically on the own needs. e.g. own legend box size, 
                red heading 2 right positioned, or dashed legend box outline, zigzag line for the line symbols, 
                position of the label etc.
                <LineBreak/>
                For creating a legend template a collection of following sketch elements must exist in the reference style:
                <LineBreak/>
                legend box in fill symbols,
                <LineBreak/>
                marker in marker symbols,
                <LineBreak/>
                line and bracketline in line symbols,
                <LineBreak/>
                headings 1 to 3 and bracket text and „graphics “- text and
                <LineBreak/>
                legend text and label in text symbols.
            </Paragraph>

                <Bold>2. Draw the legend:</Bold>
                <LineBreak/>
                The legend generator opens the indicated legend table sorted by sort field, 
                and opens it as SQL query filtered, if this were defined. 
                For each data record (line) now a legend position is provided like a clon of the legend template. 
                By entries in the field L_GROUP packed, combined or by entries in the field L_GRAPHICS completely 
                or partly replaced by legend graphics. Headings and brackets are set again or terminated 
                by current comparisons of preceding cell contents. 
                Zero entries (no cell value) cannot be processed, and are therefore represented by „#“. 
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Bold>Tip:</Bold> The legend generator draws each legend position, which is present as line in the legend table, 
                after the sort sequence into the layout. But not if it was eliminated by an attribute query, 
                or a spatial query (considering only visible data content).

                <Bold>3. Create a table for style dump:</Bold>
                <LineBreak/>
                With the function „style dump table“ a legend table for the indicated reference 
                style can be produced. A copy of the style file (mdb file) is reduced to the symbol 
                tables and stored compressed into a path directory, which you can define during the 
                style-dump process in a prompted window. The personal geodatabase saved as e.g. 
                „tmp_9028284.mdb “contains the generated legend table. Now with the legend generator 
                can be drawn in the page layout.
