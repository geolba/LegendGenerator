# LegendGenerator

The legend generator is an ArcMap program extension and installable tool into the ArcMap graphical user interface. 
It is written in C#.NET and ArcObjects and is freely usable as OpenGIS software (see license agreement). 
The functionality of the tool was designed particularly to the requirements of traditional „geological cartography“. 
Only from one legend table, which contains all symbol names, a legend can be created graphically in the page layout. 
ArcMap mxd's or layer files in all variations and versions are no longer necessary for the graphical representation 
of a geological map. A complete map can be copied thereby by an editor at the next in one Geodatabase file (mdb file).
